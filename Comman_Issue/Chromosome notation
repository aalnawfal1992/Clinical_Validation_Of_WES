Due to Chromosome notation differences in the different databases, you have to ensure that all the files used (Fasta, Bed, and VCF) are in the same notation.

For example, sometimes, it's written like Chr1 or simple 1.

If you have the same issue, please use the below command as needed

#Remove Chr :
awk '{gsub(/^chr/,""); print}' "InFile" > "OutFile"

#Add Chr:
awk '{if($0 !~ /^#/) print "chr"$0; else print $0}' "InFile" > "OutFile"
